Purpose:
Overflowing garbage bins have been a big cause of concern for residents in developing countries. With the already prevailing diseases, the open containers are proving to be a breeding place for germs. In countries like India, municipalities operate on weekly/monthly routes to pick up trash on particular day of week, regardless of the fact whether the containers are full or not. Our project aims to solve this problem.
